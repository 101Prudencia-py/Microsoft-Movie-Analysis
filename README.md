# Microsoft-Movie-Analysis

## Overview
***
Microsoft have decided to create a new movie studio and require more insight into which types of films are doing best at the box office in order to choose the genre of movies to produce that can generate the most profit.
This project uses descriptive statistical analysis on data gathered from [IMDb website](https://www.imdb.com/) to gain insight into which combination of genres topped the league in these areas.
