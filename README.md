## Overview

###### Business Problem
Microsoft have decided to create a new movie studio and require more insight into which types of films are doing best at the box office in order to choose the genre of movies to produce that can generate the most profit.

This project uses descriptive statistical analysis on data gathered from [IMDb website](https://www.imdb.com/) to gain insight into which combination of genres topped the league in these areas.

Three seperate datasets were used for this analysis to gain insight into which combination genres of movies topped the domestic gross sales, foreign gross sales, had the top average ratings and number of votes.  The results of the top 20 combination genres in Domestic Sales, Foreign Sales and number of votes was clearly the combination Action, Adventure & Sci-Fi, with adventure being present in the majority of the top 20 of the 3 categories. My recommendation for which type of Movie to produce would be Action, Adventure & Sci-Fi as this is the most predominant combination in the analysis. In Domestic and Foreign gross the combination Adventure, Animation & Comedy also faired well which would be my second recommendation.I would also highly recommend that Adventure and Action paired with either Animation or Fantasy  is a successful combination.Adventure was clearly a strong genre for popular successful movies as it appeared in all combinations of genre for the top 3 highest domestic gross.

### Methods
***
The data analysed came from IMDb website. IMDb (an acronym for Internet Movie Database) is a popular worldwide online database of infomation relating to all movies, television programs, video games and streaming content online. I used 3 files from IMDb to answer the question of which genres were most successful, mainly focusing on the Domestic and Foreign Gross sales along with average ratings given and number of votes received.
